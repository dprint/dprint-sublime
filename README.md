# dprint - Sublime Text Plugin

Sublime Text formatting extension for [dprint](https://dprint.dev)â€”a pluggable and configurable formatting platform.

## Setup

1. Install [dprint's CLI](https://dprint.dev/install).
2. Install Sublime Text plugin via [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/dprint)
3. Run `dprint init` in the root directory of your repository to create a configuration file.

## Features

Formats code in the editor using [dprint](https://dprint.dev).

Plugins are currently resolved based on the configuration file found based on the current file (in any ancestor directory or ancestor `config` sub directory).

## Commands

* `dprint_fmt` - Formats the code being edited.

## Slower

Note, this plugin is slower than the one available for vscode because it will startup the dprint process each time for every format. It could be made faster if someone wants to implement it using the editor-service API: https://github.com/dprint/dprint/blob/main/docs/editor-extension-development.md (wait for editor-service schema v5 to be finalized though)
